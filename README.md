# 🛍️ Customer Shopping behavior — EDA Project

An end-to-end exploratory data analysis project examining customer shopping behavior across three tools: **Python** for data cleaning, **MySQL** for business queries, and **Power BI** for interactive visualisation.

---

## 📌 Project Goal

The goal was to move beyond surface-level summaries and uncover meaningful patterns in the data — who's spending the most, how discounts influence purchasing decisions, whether subscribers are actually more valuable, and how behavior shifts across age groups and genders.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning (Python)

The raw dataset was processed in `Customer_Shopping_behavior.ipynb`:

- Handled missing values in the `review_rating` column
- Standardised all column names to `snake_case`
- Removed duplicate or redundant columns
- Engineered two new features:
  - **`age_group`** — categorises customers into meaningful age brackets
  - **`purchase_frequency_days`** — converts purchase cadence text into a numeric value
- Loaded the cleaned data into a local MySQL database (`pandasdb`) using SQLAlchemy

---

## 🗄️ SQL Analysis

Ten business questions were explored in `customer_behavior.sql`:

1. Total revenue generated by male vs. female customers
2. Customers who used a discount but still exceeded average spend
3. Top 5 products by average review rating
4. Average spend comparison — Standard vs. Express shipping
5. Subscriber vs. non-subscriber spend and revenue comparison
6. Top 5 products with the highest discount application rate
7. Customer segmentation into **New**, **Returning**, and **Loyal** tiers
8. Top 3 most purchased products within each category (using `ROW_NUMBER()`)
9. Repeat buyers (>5 purchases) and their subscription likelihood
10. Revenue contribution broken down by age group

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

The `.pbix` file brings the analysis together into an interactive dashboard covering:

- Revenue breakdown by gender and age group
- Subscription impact on spending
- Product performance and category trends
- Customer segmentation visualisation
- Discount behavior patterns

---

## 🚀 How to Run

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib sqlalchemy pymysql
```

**Step 1 — Clean the data:**
- Open `Customer_Shopping_behavior.ipynb`
- Update the CSV file path in the first cell
- Run all cells — this cleans the data and loads it into MySQL (`pandasdb`)

**Step 2 — Run the SQL queries:**
- Open `customer_behavior.sql` in MySQL Workbench
- Make sure the `pandasdb` database exists and `customer_behavior` table is loaded
- Run queries individually or all at once

**Step 3 — Explore the dashboard:**
- Open `Customer_behavior.pbix` in Power BI Desktop
- Refresh the data source to connect to your local MySQL instance

---

## 📝 Notes

- The SQL queries assume a MySQL database named `pandasdb` with a table named `customer_behavior`
- Power BI was connected to the local MySQL instance — update the data source path after opening the `.pbix` file
- The two engineered features (`age_group`, `purchase_frequency_days`) are only present in the cleaned version of the data used for SQL and Power BI, not in the raw CSV
